# TBB_Integral

## Task
The main problem is creating a parallel program that calculates integral functions on a specified integral.
The parallel program is composed of tasks to which a integral function interval, that has to be calculated, is given. If the integral is larger than a set length the program will split and create a number of tasks according to the number of splits. The goal is creating a binary tree for executing tasks to improve programs performance.
